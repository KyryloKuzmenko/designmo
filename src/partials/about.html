    <p class="about-text">
      Interio is a fully immersive 3D home design simulator where creativity meets functionality. Designed for mobile,
      the game invites you into beautifully modeled virtual spaces where you take on the role of an interior designer.
      Each project challenges you to match materials, colors, textures, and layouts according to client needs or your
      own vision. Whether you're designing a rustic bathroom or a modern kitchen, every room is a blank canvas waiting
      for your imagination.<br />
      Interio isn't just about visual appeal — it's a sandbox where you learn by doing. The game introduces real-world
      design logic: balance, harmony, spatial planning, and finish coordination. Through gameplay, you’ll understand how
      to layer lighting, how different textures interact, and how to make spaces feel functional and expressive.<br />
      Unlike many casual decorating games, Interio provides depth through its room-specific challenges, dynamic scoring
      system, and unlockable material libraries. You can freely rotate views, zoom in on furniture placements, and plan
      each design to the smallest detail. Whether you're completing a challenge or building your personal dream home,
      Interio gives you full control to shape beautiful, cohesive interiors.<br />
      It's ideal for hobbyists, design students, or anyone planning a renovation who wants to experiment in a low-risk,
      creative space. By playing Interio, you don’t just design — you develop your skills and discover your style.
